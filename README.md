message app thruw sharing urls
In this app I encoded a message that user has entred thruw acsii to base 32 then added to the html to give the users secret message url.
In order to obtain Url I used third party program vercel and github to connect my program to the server.
People who are user in vercel cna access my secret message site and create encoded message thruw url to the next person.
